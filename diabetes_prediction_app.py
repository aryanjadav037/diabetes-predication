        ### What does this mean?
        Based on the input data provided, the model suggests that there is a high probability that the patient has diabetes.

        ### Next Steps:
        - **Consult a healthcare professional**: It's important to consult with a doctor for a comprehensive evaluation and diagnosis.
        - **Lifestyle Changes**: Consider adopting a healthier lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight.
        - **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels as advised by your healthcare provider.

        ### About Diabetes:
        Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by high levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood. Early diagnosis and management are crucial to prevent complications. There are two main types of diabetes:
        - **Type 1 Diabetes**: An autoimmune condition where the body attacks insulin-producing cells.
        - **Type 2 Diabetes**: A condition where the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin.

        ### What does this mean?
        Based on the input data provided, the model suggests that there is a low probability that the patient has diabetes.

        ### Recommendations:
        - **Healthy Lifestyle**: Continue to follow a healthy lifestyle to reduce the risk of developing diabetes in the future.
        - **Regular Check-ups**: Regular health check-ups with your healthcare provider can help you stay on top of your health.

        ### About Diabetes:
        Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by high levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood. While this prediction is a positive sign, it is important to maintain regular health check-ups and a healthy lifestyle to ensure long-term well-being.
